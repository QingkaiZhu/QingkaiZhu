I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computational Cognitive Science at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. Before this, I accumulated seven years of experience as an open-source software developer, alongside earning a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. My primary research interest is to use mathematical and computational models to explore brain dynamics. I am passionate about drawing inspiration for Machine Learning algorithms from the cutting-edge developments in (Cognitive) Neuroscience.
